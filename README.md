# My Personal Project

##  Experience Journal *(name in progress)*

### Overview

For my CPSC 210 project, I am designing an app that allows
users to record, rate and describe their experiences in life 

This can look like:
- **Rating** favourite places to eat around the city
- **Ranking** and **reviewing** favorite movies or tv shows
- **Reflecting** on courses taken throughout school
- and **many** more...

Users will be able to add and label their entry along with
adding optional ratings *(using points out of 10 or stars for example)*
and also including a description detailing their experience or any other
notes. These entries can be sorted into categories however the user pleases
and can be updated to track changes over time.

### Why did I choose this project?

As someone who greatly enjoys trying new things and building new experiences,
it often gets hard keeping track of all the different things I have tried
and remembering my initial thoughts of them, especially after time passes.

With an app like this, that is no longer an issue. Initial thoughts can be kept
for later review, new and changed opinions can be added to comparison, and overall, 
all of life's experiences can be kept handy. It is like an interactive journal.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add an item entry to my journal with necessary ratings and descriptions
- As a user, I want to be able to view previously made entries
- As a user, I want to be able to remove an item entry to my journal
- As a user, I want to be able to update my item entry
- As a user, I want to be able to have the option to save the entire state of the application to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load a state from file and resume where I left off
